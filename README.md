# Prototype: Attractor Reconstruction of a Dark-Matter Field

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17216752.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17216752)

This repository hosts the LaTeX source and compiled PDF for a hypothesis note
exploring whether dark-matter fields can be reconstructed as **attractors** of a
fixed-point operator.

The framework alternates:

- **Gravitational relaxation** under the Vlasov–Poisson equations, and
- **Observational pull-backs** from gravitational lensing and stellar stream
  data.

If stable attractors exist, they may provide a way to extract the hidden
“kernel” of dark-matter clustering from existing surveys.

## Background

This concept was inspired by Geoffrey Hinton’s public remarks
https://youtu.be/n4IQOBka8bc?si=1WIp1HJTVXEVlM35 that AI might be uniquely
suited to connecting seemingly unrelated ideas. Using large language models for
brainstorming, I developed a prototype formulation that bridges
dynamical-systems techniques in cosmology with mathematical structures familiar
from machine-learning attention mechanisms.

The resulting note includes:

- A mathematical energy functional
- Operator formulation and stability conditions
- Pseudocode sketch in Python
- Discussion of nonlocal priors and toy examples

## Status

This is **not a claim of discovery**. It is a **testable framework** shared
openly to invite critique, stress-testing, and adaptation by specialists in:

- Gravitational lensing
- Stellar dynamics and streams
- Inverse problems in cosmology

Even null results would be informative, particularly regarding the convergence
behavior of ΛCDM compared to alternative dark matter models.
